lyrics: Percy Mayfield

strophes: |-
  Hit the road Jack and don't you come back
  No more, no more, no more, no more
  Hit the road Jack and don't you come back no more
  What you say?
  Hit the road Jack and don't you come back
  No more, no more, no more, no more
  Hit the road Jack and don't you come back no more
  
  1.
  Old woman, old woman, don't treat me so mean
  You're the meanest old woman that I've ever seen
  I guess if you said so
  I'll have to pack my things and go (that's right)
  |: Hit the road Jack... :|
  
  2.
  Now baby, listen baby, don't ya treat me this way
  'Cause I'll be back on my feet some day
  (Don't care if you do 'cause it's understood)
  (You ain't got no money, you just ain't no good)
  Well, I guess if you say so
  I'll have to pack my things and go (that's right)
  
  3.
  Well (don′t you come back no more)
  Uh, what'd you say? (Don′t you come back no more)
  I didn't understand it! (Don't you come back no more)
  You can′t mean that! (Don′t you come back no more)
  Oh, now, baby, please! (Don't you come back no more)
  What you tryin′ to do to me? (Don't you come back no more)
  Oh, don't treat me like that (Don't you come back no more)
  
  You must be joking! (Don't you come back no more)
  Can't we talk it over? (Don't you come back no more)
  I thought we had a better understanding (Don't you come back no more)
  Oh baby, don't be so chicken (Don't you come back no more)
  You don't want to see me cry? (Don't you come back no more)
  Oh baby, please! (Don't you come back no more)
  It isn't fair! (Don't you come back no more)
  Hey! (Don't you come back no more)
  (Don't you come back no more)
